# QUIZ creator for React

It's great to study by reading/watching/doing anything related to the topic and then in the next 20 minutes, an hours and a day after, you solve quizzes that ask you questions from the topic you've been studying. The goal of this project is to create the tool to build questions quizzes easily in a JSON that can then be parsed by any app. I will of course also work on an app that will ask the questions.

A long-term goal would be to generate many questions on different topics in React and link them to large or well known resources, videos, articles, books. With this, learners can cement their knowledge by solving these quizzes after reading each chapter or watching videos. Hopefully, the creators (or other readers) of such resources can use the tools to hand-pick existing questions and link them to the articles. And a comunity can work on adding more questions to the library to pick from.

### The sample `react-questions.json` file
I've created a sample JSON file to showcase a potential structure of the data that would be needed. For now, nothing is set in stone and the structure might change. I would love to also open this in an API to pull questions from for all the "build a quiz" challenges. It doesn't even need to only be react :)
